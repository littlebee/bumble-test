# bumble-test
A test runner setup for running Mocha + Chai + Sinon + JsDom that will proabably not work with your code. 

This is the test runner script I built with help from some really great packages like Mocha, Chai, Sinon and jsDom.  You should need to require any of the above dependencies in your project.  Just provide bin/testRunner.coffee with the path where it can find your tests

Currently works with tests written in plain ES5 javascript, coffeescript and cjsx
